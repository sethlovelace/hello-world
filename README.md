# hello-world
This is my first repository, and is being used to learn how GitHub functions

My name is Seth, and I am teaching myself about how GitHub works so that I can push forward with my own independent coding projects. In this way, I will be able to learn valuable skills that will prepare me for working in technical teams as I continue along the path of entrepreneurship.
